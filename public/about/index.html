Iâ€™m Hammed, a Software Engineer based in the UK, passionate about backend and infrastructure engineering. I enjoy building products and being part of fast-paced startup environments where ideas quickly turn into real-world impact.
Iâ€™ve been writing Go (Golang) for the past five years, and itâ€™s still my go-to language for building reliable systems. Before that, I spent a good amount of time with Java (which I still think is an excellent language). These days, Iâ€™ve been tinkering with Rust and exploring how it can fit into my toolset.">

    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Hammed, a Software Engineer based in the UK, passionate about backend and infrastructure engineering. I enjoy building products and being part of fast-paced startup environments where ideas quickly turn into real-world impact.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve been writing <strong>Go (Golang)</strong> for the past five years, and itâ€™s still my go-to language for building reliable systems. Before that, I spent a good amount of time with Java (which I still think is an excellent language). These days, Iâ€™ve been <strong>tinkering with Rust</strong> and exploring how it can fit into my toolset.</p>
<p>Most of my experience comes from working in the <strong>UK fintech space</strong>, where Iâ€™ve helped build everything from <strong>credit systems</strong> and <strong>personal credit monitoring tools</strong> to <strong>wealth management</strong> and <strong>investment banking platforms</strong>, some of which are used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.</p>
<p>Beyond work, I love experimenting with side projects that push my understanding of technology. Some of my open-source work includes <a href="https://github.com/adxgun/sarabi">sarabi</a>(which hosts this website), <a href="https://github.com/adxgun/registry-auth">registry-auth</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/adxgun">more</a>. Recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring LLMs usages through silly experiments like restaurant menu extraction from images to structured JSON APIs, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Some tools that I love to use:</strong> Go, Java, Docker, CI/CD, Redis, PostgresSQL</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities as a Founding Engineer.
