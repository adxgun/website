ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

I'm Hammed, a Software Engineer based in the UK, passionate about backend and infrastructure engineering. I enjoy building products and being part of fast-paced startup environments where ideas quickly turn into real-world impact.

Iâ€™ve been writing **Go (Golang)** for the past five years, and itâ€™s still my go-to language for building reliable systems. Before that, I spent a good amount of time with Java (which I still think is an excellent language). These days, Iâ€™ve been **tinkering with Rust** and exploring how it can fit into my toolset.

Most of my experience comes from working in the **UK fintech space**, where Iâ€™ve helped build everything from **credit systems** and **personal credit monitoring tools** to **wealth management** and **investment banking platforms**, some of which are used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.

Beyond work, I love experimenting with side projects that push my understanding of technology. Some of my open-source work includes [sarabi](https://github.com/adxgun/sarabi)(which hosts this website), [registry-auth](https://github.com/adxgun/registry-auth), and [more](https://github.com/adxgun). Recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring LLMs usages through silly experiments like restaurant menu extraction from images to structured JSON APIs, among others.

**Some tools that I love to use:** Go, Java, Docker, CI/CD, Redis, PostgresSQL

### ðŸš€ Opportunities

Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities as a Founding Engineer.
